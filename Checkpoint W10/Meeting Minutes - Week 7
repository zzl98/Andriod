Meeting Minutes
In this meeting, we mainly talked about what we really want to do for our app, and how we are going to implement it. After some discussion, we all decided that we are going to make an app which allow users to post information about any subject and share their opinions, similar to Reddit. However, we are all not very experienced with using databse, so we have decided to research on this topic and learn more about it before the next meeting. Meanwhile, we also needed to have a clearer plan for our app design, so we agreed to come up with more ideas for the app and decide the main activities we need for the app by the next meeting.

TODO Items
Learn more about database.
Plan basic structure for the app.
Improve previous UI design and fix small issues.
Think of more ideas for the app.
