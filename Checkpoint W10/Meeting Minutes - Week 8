Meeting Minutes
In this meeting, we have decided what general form our app is going to look like, and we agreed that we are going to need a loginpage as first page, a main page to go after logged in, a separate page to create and view the post and creating, and navigation bars to go between these pages. We have all agreed that we are going to split doing these pages, and we will create a general layout and structure for the project by our next meeting. We also talked briefly about what data structure we are going to use and how we will store our information, including user info and post info, and we decided that we will use a Sqlite database with Json file to store the two data types separately.
