Meeting Minutes
In this meeting, we decided that we would finish the a app with the function we want before the next week. That is, have a valid posting function, allow others to view and search post, and be able to store user and post information. Our major roles were divided into 3 large parts: finishing the construction of the database, first of all, since that is what`s required for login and search function. Also, finish most of the UI design for the app and make it look like an actual app, and allow the user to add images. And for the search function, implement a tokenizer and parser that would be able to recongize the keywords in the search argument, and be able to sort the search results by time. So we divided these tasks into parts for everyone.
